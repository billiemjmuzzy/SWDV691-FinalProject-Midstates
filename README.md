# Inventory Management System
## SWDV-691 Final Project

The project is an Inventory Management System (IMS) for Midstates Equipment and Supply. The 
IMS will allow the user to enter data about their equipment in a form. After the form is submitted, 
the data will upload to their site. The IMS will also include authentication for security purposes.

The Midstates website is currently static, and they do not have a way to change out the items 
they have in inventory easily. The client has limited experience in web development and 
frequently runs into issues when trying to update their existing static website. The layout of the site 
is not formatted like how it was initially and is not user friendly.
